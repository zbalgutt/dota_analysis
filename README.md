# 🎮 Dota2 Data Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis of Dota 2 match data using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. The project focuses on uncovering gameplay patterns, hero trends, and performance insights through data visualization and statistical summaries to better understand the mechanics and outcomes of matches.

---

## 🧠 Objective
- Explore key metrics from Dota 2 match data  
- Identify hero pick rates, win rates, and other game dynamics  
- Produce visualizations that reveal patterns in match outcomes and gameplay behavior  
- Provide insights driven by data rather than intuition

---

## 📊 What’s Inside
- **Dota Analysis.ipynb** – A comprehensive Jupyter notebook with:
  - Data loading and preprocessing
  - Exploratory plots (win rates, hero popularity, match duration, etc.)
  - Statistical summaries and comparisons
  - Commentary and interpretation of results

---

## 📁 Dataset
The data analyzed is drawn from the open-sourced platform called OpenDota. It includes hero selections, match results, player/team performance metrics, and other relevant game variables.

> Note: The exact dataset source and preprocessing steps are documented within the notebook.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **pandas, numpy** for data handling
- **matplotlib, seaborn** for visualization
- Interactive widgets for dynamic insights

---

## 💡 Key Insights (Examples)
- Hero pick and win rate distributions
- Trends in match duration relative to team outcomes
- Performance differences across hero roles
- Patterns that may inform player strategy and game balance

---

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone the repository  
2. Install dependencies (e.g., `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter`)  
3. Open and run the `Dota Analysis.ipynb` notebook  
4. Explore visualizations and adapt analyses to your data

---

## 📌 Notes
This analysis is a self-directed project to practice EDA techniques and gain insights from game data. Visualizations and results are intended for interpretation and further exploration by the data science community.
